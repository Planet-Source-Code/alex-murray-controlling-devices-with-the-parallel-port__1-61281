## Controlling Devices With The Parallel Port


</div>

### Description

If you want to control devices with a parallel port, such as a case fan or a LED or whatever, this article is for you. Every case fan on my computer at home is hooked up to my parallel port so I can switch them on and off whenever I feel like it. I've tried to keed it as simple as possible without leaving out any important information. If you find any bit hard to understand, give us some feedback and I'll try my best to explain it in more detail asap. I hope you enjoy the Article...
